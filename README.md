# Celebrity-retweet-investigation
In this project I am testing whether the posts of a famous chinese celebrity 'Cai' on his social media 'Weibo' receive abnormally high amount of retweets and investigate the reason behind it.
Here I use webscrapping, A/B test, Text-mining, and data visualization to support my claim that the celebrity indeed has abnormal amount of retweets, and one of the reason is that his fans has abnormal Weibo accounts behavior, which resembles bot behavior.
